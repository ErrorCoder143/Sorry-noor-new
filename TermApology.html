  <h1>I'm Sorry, Noor</h1>
  <div class="letter">
    <p>Dear Noor,</p>

    <p>I’ve spent some time reflecting on my words and actions — and I realize how deeply I may have hurt you. That was never my intention. If I could take back the moment, I would, not for my own comfort, but to spare you from any pain I caused.</p>

    <p>You have always meant so much to me. Your kindness, your strength, your light — they’re things I truly value, even if I don’t always express it the right way. Sometimes we mess up the most with the people we care about the most, and for that, I’m truly sorry.</p>

    <p>I’m not asking you to forget. I just hope you can feel the sincerity in my apology. I want to make things right. Not with grand words, but with better actions going forward — ones that show how much I respect, appreciate, and care for you.</p>

    <p>Please forgive me, Noor. From the heart.</p>

    <div class="signature">
      With all sincerity,<br>
      [Your Name]
